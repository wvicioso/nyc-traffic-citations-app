# NYC Traffic Citations App


### How to run:

1) Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/wvicioso/nyc-traffic-citations-app.git`
2) In the command line, type: `yarn launch` or `npm install && npm start` if you do not use yarn.

### App Description

This app uses NYC Open Data API (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) which gives the public access to data provided by hundreds of NYC Government Agencies.

The data found in the app is pulled from the NYC Department of Finance. Within the app, you can find details like Traffic Citation type, date, and aggregate values like Total Citations on a certain day, and Total Amount of Dollars generated by the city for citations.

### Development Details

I tried to limit the number of dependencies which is why I am only using what is provided upon initialization of the project.

All state variables are managed in the outermost level of the application in `src/App.js` which is ideal when a state management system like Redux is not being used. Since all the state management logic is already located in a single place, the process of implementing Redux later would be seamless.

### Design

I am not a designer but I did my best in making the UI presentable.
